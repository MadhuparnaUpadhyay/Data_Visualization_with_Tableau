# About

This project was to analyze the amount of Energy Consumption from sources like Electricity, Oil and Gas. The dashboard has the perfect blend of Total Units versus categorical distibution between the sources and the Share across the countries.

Additional story is the transfromation and the trend toward the Renewable sources of Energy and another sub-categorisation with heat map for renewable and green sources of energy.

The Energy Share on the hover gives individual country trend during the ten year period.
